#hashtable implementation
HOW TO RUN(on linux):
1. Open the terminal with the folder containing code files and type 'make' and press enter.
2. Now, type './output'.



Assumptions:

1. The user will enter a valid size, that is a size more than the number of entries he is expecting.
2. As we use double hashing the size of the table should be a prime number else traversals might become infinite loops. So, a prime number is expected from the user.
3. Recommended value of size is 4001, as it satisfies both the above points w.r.t the given dataset.
